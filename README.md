## Testing Solidity with Python using Wake

One of the key features of this extension pack is the seamless integration with the [Wake](https://getwake.io) tool by Ackee Blockchain. Wake allows you to write Solidity tests using Python, enabling you to leverage the full power of Python for both unit and fuzz tests. Testing Solidity code with Python is easy and quick, and enables powerfull features such as differential testing.
